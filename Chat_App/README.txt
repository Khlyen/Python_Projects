A very basic chat application coded by python.
In order for it to work you must change the ip address in both files with your local ip adress.
(For windows open command line then type ipconfig and ipv4 is your local ip adress.)
In order to run application via internet you must make a port redirection in your modem. Otherwise it only works in your local network.

How to use it:

1- Run server.py once
2- Run client gui as many times as you want.(You can test the app with multiple instances of client gui)
