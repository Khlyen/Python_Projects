A very basic chat application coded by python.
In order for it to work you must change the ip address in both files with your local ip adress.
(For windows open command line then type ipconfig and ipv4 is your local ip adress.)
In order to run application via internet you must make a port redirection in your modem. Otherwise it only works in your local network.
