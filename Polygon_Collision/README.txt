A physics engine for handling regular polygon collisions coded with python.

This program works as istented but has serious performance issues and will likely give errors if run for a while.
But the main purpose was to make collision calculations correct which it does.

Objects are making fully ellastic collisions. So there is no energy loss(except the ones caused from rounding errors) or friction between objects.
Because of no friction impact vector only acts in the normal direction.
